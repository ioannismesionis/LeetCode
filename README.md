# LeetCode Knowledge Base

This repository captures my learnings from solving LeetCode problems. Each note focuses on the essential ideas, solution patterns, and implementation details that will help me revisit the problem quickly later on.

## Repository Layout

- `problems/` contains Markdown notes for individual problems, grouped by difficulty.
- `patterns/` highlights reusable techniques (e.g., sliding window, two pointers) with links to the problems that use them.
- `templates/` stores reusable code snippets or language-specific boilerplates.

Feel free to adapt the structure if a different organization makes more sense for a topic.

## Adding a New Problem Note

1. Create a new Markdown file under the relevant difficulty folder in `problems/`.
2. Use the template below to keep the documentation consistent:

```markdown
# Problem Title (LeetCode #)

## Problem
Short description in my own words.

## Key Ideas
- Core observations or invariants.
- Mention patterns or data structures that apply.

## Solution Outline
1. Key algorithm step 1.
2. Key algorithm step 2.

## Complexity
- Time: O(...)
- Space: O(...)

## Implementation Notes
- Edge cases or pitfalls to remember.

## References
- [LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/...)
- Related patterns or similar problems.
```

3. Add the problem to the relevant section in `patterns/` if it illustrates a specific technique.

## Next Steps

- Backfill notes for problems I've already solved.
- Capture broader patterns, key mistakes, and review timelines in `patterns/`.
- Add code templates or helper utilities in `templates/` as I standardize solutions.
