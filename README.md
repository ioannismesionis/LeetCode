## 🚀 Running the Solutions

Each solution is self-contained and can be run independently:

```python
python3 week-1/single_number.py
```

Most files include example test cases at the bottom to demonstrate functionality.

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

Solutions focus on optimal time and space complexity:
- Most array problems: O(n) time, O(1) space
- Tree problems: O(n) time, O(h) space where h is height
- Dynamic programming: Various optimizations applied

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this challenge, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Algorithm design patterns
- Time and space complexity optimization
- Python data structures and built-in functions
- Problem-solving approaches for technical interviews
